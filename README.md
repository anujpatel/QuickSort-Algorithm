QuickSort-Algorithm
===================

QuickSort Algorithm implementation using Java

Quick Sort works on Divide and Conquer algorithm. Here, given array is divided into two parts, left and right. and both array are being sorted individually. After then we combine and will have sorted array.

How it works:

    1. Pick up any element in Array. ex. middle element of array. we called this one as Pivot.
    2. All elements which are smaller than Pivot are placed in one array and All elements which are larger than pivot are       placed in another array
    3. Using recursion sort both array using quicksort
    4. Combine array
